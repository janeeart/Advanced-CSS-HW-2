# Advanced-CSS-HW-2

This is a web application built without starter code that acts as a professional web development portfolio. The purpose of this web application is to showcase deployed web projects for prospective employers.

## Description

 This web application applies recently learned skills such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. Some animation was added to elements which will appear on a desktop when hovering with a mouse and when the page loads on all devices. Placeholder images and names were used for most web applications until more projects are ready to be showcased.
